**Oh no, internet out???** -
Get `I WANT INTERNET`, we stress the fact that you want Internet™ and this irritation is a result of withdrawal. We strongly believe that Internet™ is not a need, rather, it is a want.

**How to use I WANT INTERNET?**

1. Click on `IWANTINTERNET.jar` as fast as you can
2. Input an IP or web address, strictly without `https://` or `http://` (use the "bald" address; eg. `www.google.com`)
3. Normally keep it as default (`8.8.8.8` / `www.google.com`) unless you know what you're doing
4. Check `Notify Me` so you get an annoying Windows notification when Internet™ connection is made
5. Right-click on Tray-Icon for options (Windows only - Default located at right side of taskbar in the upwards arrow)
